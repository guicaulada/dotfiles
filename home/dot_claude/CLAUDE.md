# Global Guidelines

## Language

All code, comments, documentation, commits, configs, errors, and tests in English.

## Workflow

- **Explore first**: Read relevant files and understand context before writing code
- **Plan before implementing**: Use extended thinking for complex changes
- **Iterate with tests**: Write or update tests, verify they pass before committing
- **Commit incrementally**: Atomic commits as you complete logical units
- **Parallelize**: Use subagents for independent tasks that can run concurrently

## GitHub

Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, releases).
